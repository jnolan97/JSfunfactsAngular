<p>Callback functions are very commonly used in JavaScript as we know that JavaScript in the browser is single-threaded. In general, a callback is a piece of code which is passed as an argument to some other code. This code calls back or executes the argument as per its convenience. The call back can be either synchronous or asynchronous.
     Synchronous callbacks are referred as 'Callbacks' while asynchronous callbacks are referred as 'Deferred callbacks'. </p>
